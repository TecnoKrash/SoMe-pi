    <head>
        <title>Some-Ï€ test</title>
        <cowx>util.cowx</cowx>

    <body>
        <!include-things/> // Links in head don't work, so they are added manually with this

        <main>
            <h1>This is a title</h1>

            This is some text with maths: 
            $$
                {?sqrt 2} / 2 = 1 / {?sqrt 2} 
            $$

            And this is a test canvas with an animation: 
            <!figure id="test-canvas" :caption="A rotating cube"></figure>

            Look in the console to see rust in action (ignore all the errors)!

            <br/>
            <br/>

            There is also draggable handles:
            <!figure id="test-handles" :caption="Draggable handles!"></figure>
            
        </main>
    </body>
